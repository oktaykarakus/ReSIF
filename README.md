## Towards Minimal Supervision for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery

This project mainly focuses on reducing the labelling budget for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery. We used the following techniques for this purpose:

-AMM-FuseNet -- exploring multi-modality 
-CGSSL -- develop multi-model semi-supervised learning framework
